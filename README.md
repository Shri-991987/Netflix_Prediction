# Netflix Data Analysis and Visualization Project

Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's dataset, focusing on data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to uncover trends and patterns in content distribution. The dataset provides insights into the types of shows and movies available, their release dates, ratings, country distributions, and much more. By leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, we explored key trends in Netflix’s offerings and developed a recommendation system based on similarity scores.

Project Contents
The project covers the following sections:

Data Cleaning: Handling null values, removing duplicates, and transforming columns for easier analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows)
Rating distributions across genres and types.
Country-based content analysis.
Trends in release dates and monthly/annual distributions.
Data Visualization: Creating charts to visualize trends in Netflix content, including top-rated genres, monthly and yearly release trends, and top directors.
Feature Engineering: Adding features for in-depth analysis, such as content duration and genre counts.
Recommendation System: A content-based recommendation system to suggest similar shows or movies using cosine similarity.

Files in the Repository
netflix1.csv: The dataset file containing Netflix content information.
Netflix_Project-1.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and recommendation code.

Key Findings
Content Distribution: Majority of Netflix’s offerings are movies, with a significant portion targeted at mature audiences (TV-MA, TV-14 ratings).
Country Insights: The U.S. has the highest content production, followed by India and the UK.
Seasonal Trends: Certain months show higher content release volumes, especially around fall and winter.
Recommendation System: Using content-based filtering, users can find similar shows/movies based on genre, country, and rating attributes.
